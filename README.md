# MatchMe

## What is this project?

This is a fun side project that started out as an idea for HackMIT, and that went on to receive the Community Prize from Facebook. The core idea is to create a platform where users can share all sorts of interests and actions they've taken towards those interests, and find others to 'match' their actions, generating group, as opposed to individual, action. 

## Project Structure

Currently, MatchMe-New is not able to be run as MatchMe-HackMIT is being refined to fix bugs and flesh out features that could not be fully implemented in the short time there was for HackMIT. 

Each of the folders consists of client-side code (React) and server-side code (Django). MatchMe-HackMIT's Django generally uses the idea of REST API endpoints, whereas MatchMe-New's Django is using graphene for a GraphQL API, which is its primary difference from the original and the only reason for it existing. 

## Keep In Mind

To reiterate what was stated above, only MatchMe-HackMIT is able to be run and is being updated at the moment. MatchMe-New may be abandoned, but is still there for purposes of having fun for GraphQL instead of REST. 

These sites are NOT production ready and likely never will be. But they can be run locally, are super fun to play around with, and can help you (as you develop the code on your own and edit it) in both your frontend and backend skills.
