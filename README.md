# MatchMe

## What is this project?

This is a fun side project that started out as an idea for HackMIT, and that went on to receive the Community Prize from Facebook. The core idea is to create a platform where users can share all sorts of interests and actions they've taken towards those interests, and find others to 'match' their actions, generating group, as opposed to individual, action.

**There is a lot to fix with this project! It is a fun full-stack side project that you can fork and refine as much or as little as you want. It was made in the short time of a Hackathon and is akin to a MVP.** 

## Project Structure

Each of MatchMe-New and MatchMe-HackMIT consist of a server repository (Django) and client side (React). Their core difference is that MatchMe-New is a branch to test out GraphQL with Django and React. It is NOT intended to be run locally, whereas MatchMe-HackMIT can be run locally. 

## Keep In Mind

These sites are NOT production ready and likely never will be. But they can be run locally, are super fun to play around with, and can help you (as you develop the code on your own and edit it) in both your frontend and backend skills.
